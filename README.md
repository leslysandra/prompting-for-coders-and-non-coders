## Introduction

Prompt engineering is a powerful technique for extracting the best responses from AI models. This repository is divided into two main projects:

1. **Prompt Examples for Chatbots**: A collection of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot) for popular chatbots like ChatGPT, Mistral, and Gemini.
2. **API Integration with Prompts**: Examples demonstrating how to integrate prompts with various APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).

## Projects Overview

### Prompt Examples for Chatbots

This project focuses on providing a variety of prompt examples to interact with different chatbots. You'll find:

- **Zero-shot Prompts**: Simple prompts without additional context.
- **Few-shot Prompts**: Prompts with examples to guide the AI's response.
  
The examples are designed to showcase best practices and effective strategies for eliciting desired responses.

### API Integration with Prompts

This project demonstrates how to integrate prompts into your applications using various APIs. You'll find:

- Sample code for connecting to different AI services.
- Examples of sending prompts and handling responses programmatically.
- Guidance on managing API keys and configurations securely.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An API key for the chatbot services you plan to use (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prompting-for-coders-and-non-coders.git
